This is a proof of concept program developed in Unity, that would allow Enter Yesâ„¢ to view their 3D assets in one place. The plan was to connect to a Google Document through the Google API, where one column would contain the link to the asset.
The program would then grab all of the assets, and allow the user to view them. The user is able to change the lighting conditions, drag it around the screen, zoom in and out and rotate around to get a better look. 
Information about the asset would be taken from the Google Doc and displayed along with the asset.
At the minute, the user has to supply the 3D assets/prefabs themselves, and it gets information from a Google Doc.
